# How to use markdown language

I found recently that I can make nice formatting while creating notes on my NextCloud Notes and on GitHub.
Here I will share what I have learned so far.

## Hashes in markdown mean headings

```markdown
# Titel
## Heading1
### Heading2
#### Heading3
```
# Titel
## Heading1
### Heading2
#### Heading3

## Quote code

starting with three apostrophs \"\`\`\`markdown", \"\`\`\`bash\" and ending with three apostrophs \"\`\`\`\"

```markdown
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "My bash script."
\```
```

result

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "My bash script."
```

## Escape special caracters

this is done with backslash "\\"
